- Adopt libmnl (http://netfilter.org/projects/libmnl/) and
  drop libnetlink.{h,c}.
  Once this is done, GCC's -Wextra should be the default for the project.

- Review the whole code to remove duplicate functions between principals.
  Most of the RTNL communication should be generalized.

- Siplify Makefile making -DHID_PATH=\"../etc-test/xia/hid/\" a parameter
  to xip like what was done with --ppal-map.
  Once this is done, add this new parameter to script test.xip.

- ppk should become part of libxia. Once this is done, test_ppk should go to
  testlibxia, and Makefile simplified: drop ppk.o, test_ppk.o, -lcrypto,
  and "-L ../libxia -lxia" becomes default.
